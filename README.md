# EEB napkin

An attempt at making a version of Evan Chen's [infintely large napkin](https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html) for theoretical ecology and evolutionary biology.</br>

With theoretical ecology and evolutionary biology, a very similar problem arises. For instance, one often runs into a situation like the following:
</br>
</br>
> I’ll be eating a quick lunch with some empiricist friends from across the campus.
> They’ll ask me what I’ve been up to the last few weeks, and I’ll tell them that I’ve been thinking about adaptive dynamics in social insects.

This is my (currently very preliminary) attempt at including some basic notions from evolutionary theory on a napkin.
